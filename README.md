# Caesar Cipher

-- in progress --
(description to be added later)

### DONE
* Encoding / decoding message given a shift value
* Dealing with spaces

### TODO
* Dealing with punctuation
* RSA Scheme setup* - currently in progress
* I/O

*There are many ways to have a program decode a Caesar Cipher without using RSA, but I want to learn and implement
different encryption methods for my own growth and pleasure
